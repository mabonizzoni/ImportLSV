# ImportLSV
Python code with minimal external dependencies to re-format results from multiple linear sweep voltammetry experiments carried out over the same range of potentials into a single table. In the resulting table, the first column is potential (in volts, V), and the following columns correspond to currents (in amperes A) for each experimental run.
